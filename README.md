# FangFinder
Friend Finder App for HW11 UMN Coding Bootcamp.

The FangFinder app allows you to find and connect with friends, but with a twist: Buffy the Vampire Slayer! 

To use, simply download the repository, get to FangFinder in your command line directory, and connect to local server using node. 

```
node server.js
```

This will run the server.js file and connect you to a local host. If you are able to connect, you should see the following in your command line.

Copy the url provided in your command line, and paste it into an open browser window. The following page should load.

From there, simply click on "Take Survey". This survey consists of 10 questions to gauge your personality, and you are prompted to provide your name and a url of a photo to better connect you with others. Once you submit your survey, the app will match you with the Buffy character that best matches your personality, as well as provide you with the name and photo of other users that also matched that character! Find a friend and connect with your Buffy brethren!
